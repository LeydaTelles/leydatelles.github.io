As part of a management diagnostic and operations improvement initiative, I conducted an in-depth organizational analysis of JASCI Software — a fast-growing SaaS company in the warehouse management systems (WMS) space. The project examined JASCI’s formal structure, matrix-based team operations, cultural dynamics, and Glassdoor-based employee sentiment. Through this assessment, I identified key strengths such as a highly technical and innovation-oriented culture, but also uncovered structural pain points around resource allocation, communication inefficiencies, and uneven support across employee archetypes. The analysis provided actionable insights into the company's strengths and constraints, particularly in how its rapid growth challenges the coordination of cross-functional teams.

To address these operational gaps and strategically align the company for long-term success, I proposed a change initiative focused on integrating reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) into JASCI's robotics automation platform. This solution would reduce costly software customization, improve user-specific behavior, and strengthen the company’s competitive position in intelligent warehouse operations. The change proposal outlined a detailed implementation roadmap — including team structuring, stakeholder buy-in, and MVP development — while emphasizing the importance of internal brokers and executive sponsors to ensure adoption. Overall, the project provided JASCI with both a high-level organizational assessment and a strategy for scaling operations.
