Gallify was a startup that I founded which lasted for over 18 months. During that time I recruited over 15 people to our team, and made a bunch of friends along the way. Through trial, error, and a lot of pain, our team created the app. However, we did not reach product market fit, and I pulled the plug at third base. The app sucked, but it was a valuable learning experience for how to run a startup.

The app was highly technical, mainly relying on Apple's ARKit5 and ERC-720 Smart Contracts deployed on the Polygon Sidechain.

I made the repo public.
