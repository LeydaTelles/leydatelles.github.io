As Founder and CEO of Aurifex, I led the development of an AI-powered design and manufacturing platform that reimagines the custom jewelry experience through generative CAD modeling, cloud-based 3D design tools, and verified direct-to-manufacturer workflows. Our platform enabled consumers and jewelers to generate high-quality, personalized jewelry designs through natural language prompts — significantly reducing the time and cost typically associated with custom design while improving transparency and quality. We differentiated ourselves in a competitive landscape by integrating an end-to-end marketplace, offering D2C and B2B solutions through a multi-channel SaaS model supported by CRM integration and content-driven outreach

Through this venture, I defined the product vision, led cross-functional strategy, and validated both business model and technical feasibility with competitive research, financial modeling, and real-world user interviews. I oversaw the creation of revenue streams across licensing, cloud subscriptions, platform usage, and B2B support contracts, and guided the team through market analysis, GTM strategy, and platform architecture. Ultimately, we provided a scalable, AI-first platform that addressed key pain points in the $350B+ global jewelry market, such as inflated costs, lack of personalization, and limited access to trusted manufacturers.
