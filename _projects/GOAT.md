As a part of a technology strategy analysis, I co-authored a business report examining GOAT, a leading resale platform specializing in authenticated sneakers and streetwear. The project explored GOAT’s multi-faceted authentication system, which combines machine learning with human expertise to detect counterfeit goods and ensure trust in peer-to-peer transactions. We evaluated GOAT’s core operational model — particularly its "ship to verify" workflow and buyer protection policies — as well as the platform’s success in fostering community engagement among sneaker enthusiasts and rare item collectors. This analysis highlighted GOAT’s differentiation through AI/ML verification, marketplace trust, and brand partnerships with global icons like Paris Saint-Germain.

Beyond evaluating GOAT’s current structure, our team provided strategic recommendations to strengthen its competitive position in the increasingly saturated luxury resale market. We analyzed competitors such as StockX, eBay, and The RealReal, and identified opportunities for GOAT to expand user loyalty, enhance onboarding security, and leverage data analytics for dynamic pricing. We proposed the introduction of ID verification checkpoints, influencer partnerships, and deeper investments in sustainability initiatives. The project culminated in a multi-pronged strategy to reduce the cost of fraud, drive customer acquisition, and improve operational efficiency through smart automation and expanded vertical integration.
