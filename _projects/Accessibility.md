As a part of a strategic capstone project in collaboration with Workday and Carnegie Mellon University, our team conducted an exploratory study at the intersection of accessibility and artificial intelligence. The objective was to provide a detailed market map of emerging accessibility technologies and AI/ML solutions, identifying high-yield partnerships that align with Workday’s product strategy. We performed in-depth analysis across key domains—visual, physical, auditory, and neurodivergent—mapping over 20 companies, products and services through an analysis that evaluated feature success, integration effort, latency, and prototyping potential.

Beyond the market map, we conducted a comparative trade study of leading technologies and platforms, culminating in targeted recommendations for strategic partnerships with companies like VizAbility, Mentra, and Liftware. These are opportunities where AI-enhanced accessibility could meaningfully advance Workday’s product ecosystem, improve user experience for people with disabilities, and align with inclusive design principles. Our deliverables included a partnership evaluation matrix, comprehensive research report, advanced analysis on relevant technologies, and a market map to guide future product development and integration efforts.
