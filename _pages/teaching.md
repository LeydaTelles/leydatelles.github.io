      <p class="course-description">This class covers advanced topics in deep learning, ranging from optimization to computer vision, computer graphics and unsupervised feature learning, and touches on deep language models, as well as deep learning for games.</p>
      <p class="course-description">Part 1 covers the basic building blocks and intuitions behind designing, training, tuning, and monitoring of deep networks. The class covers both the theory of deep learning, as well as hands-on implementation sessions in pytorch. In the homework assignments, we will develop a vision system for a racing simulator, SuperTuxKart, from scratch.</p>
      <p class="course-description">Part 2 covers a series of application areas of deep networks in: computer vision, sequence modeling in natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and adversarial learning.

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="course-description">Artificial intelligence (AI) is both a product of and a major influence on society. As AI plays an increasingly important role in society, it is critical to understand both the ethical factors that influence the design of AI and the ethical dimensions of the impacts of AI in society.</p>
      <p class="course-description">The goal of this course is to prepare AI professionals for the important ethical responsibilities that come with developing systems that may have consequential, even life-and-death, consequences. Students first learn about both the history of ethics and the history of AI, to understand the basis for contemporary, global ethical perspectives (including non-Western and feminist perspectives) and the factors that have influenced the design, development, and deployment of AI-based systems.</p>

      <p class="course-description">Through hands-on assignments, students will re-implement smaller versions of these models, allowing them to gain practical experience and a deep understanding of how these AI technologies function. The course is designed to address the fact that only a small group of individuals, with significant resources, will ever train large frontier models. However, most professionals will interact with advanced AI models, either directly or indirectly.</p>
